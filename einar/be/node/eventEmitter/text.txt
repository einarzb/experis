1. Node.js starts
2. initializes the event loop
3. process the provided input script which may make async API calls, schedule timers,
 or call process.nextTick().
---
1. each phase has FIFO queue of callbacks to execute.
2. when the event loop enters a given phase >> it will perform any operations specific to that phase,
 then execute callbacks in that phase's queue until the queue has been exhausted or the maximum number of callbacks has
executed.
3. When the queue has been exhausted or the callback limit is reached >>
4. event loop will move to the next phase, and so on.

---
4. begins processing the event loop.


if setImeddiate is inside i/o level - it will always run first.
nextTick() is at the end of every phase (timers/etc)
