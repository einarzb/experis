<p>/*binary tree*/</p>
Each node in a tree has at most one parent, and one single node (called the root node), has no parent.
A node that has no children is called a leaf of the tree.
the root of any tree is an ancestor of every node in the tree.
A subtree in a tree is any node in the tree together with all of its descendants.
we can use trees to represent information that itself is hierarchical in nature: organizational charts and family trees.

///
perfect - all leaves have same depth
complete- always have 2 children on the left leaf

<ul>
<li>height(T) = 1 + max{height(TL), height(TR)}</li>
<li>if tree is empty then its height is -1; (n=0)</li>
<li> binray tree can have same nodes but different height</li>
<li> each node can have at most 2 children</li>
<li> root node is the first on top of tree</li>
<li></li>
    (n=1) - one tree
    (n=2) - two trees
    (n=3) - five trees

</ul>

binary search tree -
left leaf - lower child
right leaf - higher child
e.g
root (8)
first level- right(10) left (3)
2d level - root(3) left(1) right(6)
3rd level - root(6) left(4) right(7)

<h1>Tree Scanning</h1>
      <h2>in order - prints the tree by order</h2>
      <p>left - root - right</p>

      <h2>post order - to calc height of tree or delete the whole tree(starting from nodes)</h2>
      <p>left >> right >> root</p>

      <h2>pre order - calc the level of tree (root is level 0)</h2>
      <p>root>left>right</p>
